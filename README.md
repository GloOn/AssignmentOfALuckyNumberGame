# AssignmentOfALuckyNumberGame
-- This is a code of an assignment of my course, which used to create a lucky number game.---Using BlueJ.

-- I really want to make it private because I am not sure that I have the authorization to public an answer
of an assignment in my course.
But I think this project is very interesting and a good funcdation of a java programmer.

-- And it is also my first time to use Github. Hope I didn't break any law....cheers!~~
